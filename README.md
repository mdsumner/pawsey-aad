Notes and a place to share for Pawsey work. 

{bowerbird} can now transfer directly from web/S3/etc sources to file/S3, and we're in the middle of a minor-transfer, we have a tooling built on a data library created by {bowerbird} (and for us primarily defined by {blueant} https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/blueant) and we are going to re-build that on Pawsey HPC with their object-storage, we will make that (mostly, where we can) public and publish various indexes to it that will be able to map between the original source-url, the current object address (local or remote as you are), and then rewrite the original R tooling on that to deliver R-spatial or xarray to users  to continue the workflows our original stack provided - but now we can run "local" on the HPC, or on your laptop, or your own VM, or more easily make-local-copy as needed for intensive work, for whatever "local" means for a user). Really key to this will be (kerchunk)VirtualiZarr references (in json or more likely parquet), or analogously stac indexes to (probably) time-based 2D slices within the library, we'll get into the python intake stuff and also the opendatacube loading approach, and of course we'll have the original listing that our current users and functions use to read this stuff the old way (with terra, or stars, or gdalraster, as you like). I find it interesting in Pangeo/opendatacube communities where there is so much overlap with what is done in R, but R just does not register to folks there much at all. When our data library is public we'll be able to demonstrate its use more widely, and see how it fits in the overall scheme of things now. We're keeping a very close eye on kerchunk/VirtualiZarr/DMR++, on opendatacube 2.0 (it's a long horizon), and on the various friendly wrestling going on in Pangeo, where a lot of those things have very striking cross-language implications.
